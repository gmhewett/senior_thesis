I would like to thank my computer science faculty advisor, Professor Margo Seltzer, for being an incredible mentor on this project.  Thank you for sharing your passion for building and empowering me to make something that could have a real impact on people.

I would also like to thank my electrical engineering faculty advisor, Professor Gu-Yeon Wei, for his fantastic mentorship and support. Thank you for believing in me, in this idea, and for encouraging me to see it all the way through.

I would like to thank the Harvard Active Learning Labs staff for their patience, availability, and willingness to share their expertise. This project would not have been possible without you.

I want to thank all of my friends who provided me with emotional support, laughter, and honest feedback. Thank you for helping me throughout the year.

Finally, I especially want to thank my wonderful fianc√©e and family for their continued support in all of my academic and personal pursuits. I can't imagine doing this without you, and without your love and guidance, I would not be where I am today. Thank you.
