This paper consists of the design and implementation of a software platform empowering users to quickly find autoinjectors and defibrillators in emergencies by leveraging both crowdsourcing and the Internet of Things (IoT). Both autoinjectors and defibrillators are needed within minutes of an emergency to counteract anaphylactic shock and cardiac arrest respectively. Besides receiving one from an ambulance or hospital, no platform currently exists for finding or receiving an autoinjector during emergencies, and automated emergency defibrillators (AEDs) can be difficult to locate quickly when they are needed. The goal of this project is to create a platform for users to quickly and efficiently find both autoinjectors and defibrillators using a mobile app. A mobile app is used for crowdsourcing autoinjectors and finding Internet-connected smart containers that house both autoinjectors and defibrillators.
